## Description
This is my implementation of a private shared folder using socket programming and multithreading to use a few basic commands. This project is realized through python3 and using the library socket. 
Remote  folders  are  common  and  useful  applications  enabled  by  the  cloud  computing  paradigm.  In  these applications,  a  user  can  store  their  files  in  a  folder  that  resides  on  a  server.  The  user  has  access  to  common functionalities such as download, upload, delete, and see the whole content of the folder. The idea behind this project is to create a private remote shared folder that is able to share files between a client and a server.
